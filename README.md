# SixDOFinator - Sample Project

It's 6DOF head and hand tracking inside a Windows application running on WinlatorXR on a Meta Quest or Pico device! This example project has a few minigames to show off different types of game mechanics, but they're not fully fleshed out games with win/lose conditions

For the barebones version of this project which requires no external assets and has a player prefab ready to drop into your own projects, check out this repo instead: [SixDOFinator_MinimalProject](https://github.com/bigelod/SixDOFinator_MinimalProject)

If MIT license doesn't suit your needs, and you can use code under "The Unlicense" to your benefit instead, please feel free to consider this sample project as licensed under "The Unlicense" or Public Domain, I would love to see more PCVR on standalone in future!

# Special Thanks

Thanks to LuboÅ¡ for WinlatorXR and testing/debug help!
Thanks to GmoLargey for testing!

# Get WinlatorXR for your Quest or Pico device

This project is designed to run within a Windows (Wine) container on WinlatorXR, go check that out [here](https://github.com/lvonasek/WinlatorXR)

# Unity Editor Version: 
2022.3.62f1 (LTS)

# How to build (and run):

Download the source code
Install TMP Pro package from Unity editor
Install the free packages (see Assets/AssetPacks/Readme.txt)
Build and run in WinlatorXR on your Meta Quest or Pico device

WinlatorXR sends the XR data via UDP port 7872 to the container

# UDP data example string:

client0 0.080 -0.675 -0.728 -0.090 0.0 0.0 -0.210 -0.212 -0.359 -0.032 -0.609 0.790 -0.063 0.0 0.0 0.174 -0.202 -0.139 -0.036 -0.020 0.007 0.999 0.030 0.003 0.059 0.0681 99.00 103.40 255

If this isn't running inside WinlatorXR, it will create a folder on whatever drive it runs eg: D:/xrtemp

You can put a file with this UDP data string in the name and uncheck "UDP Only" in the ReadPosData script on the player to load that pose data example

# XR UDP string data format:

Left Hand Quaternion X, Left Hand Quaternion Y, Left Hand Quaternion Z, Left Hand Quaternion W, 
Left Hand Thumbstick X, Left Hand Thumbstick Y, Left Hand X Position, Left Hand Y Position, Left Hand Z Position,  
Right Hand Quaternion X, Right Hand Quaternion Y, Right Hand Quaternion Z, Right Hand Quaternion W, 
Right Hand Thumbstick X, Right Hand Thumbstick Y, Right Hand X Position, Right Hand Y Position, Right Hand Z Position,
HMD Quaternion X, HMD Quaternion Y, HMD Quaternion Z, HMD Quaternion W, 
HMD X Position, HMD Y position, HMD Z Position, Current IPD, Current FOV Horizontal, Current FOV Vertical,
XR Frame ID

The last is an INT between 0 and 255, the rest are float/double values
